    "### Accelerate Python analytics with in-database processing by using ibmdbpy and IBM Db2 Warehouse\n",
    " \n",
    "The ibmdbpy project provides access to in-database algorithms in IBM Db2 Warehouse through a Python interface for data manipulation. It accelerates Python analytics by seamlessly pushing operations written in Python into the underlying database for execution, thereby benefitting from in-database performance-enhancing features, such as columnar storage and parallel processing. For more details about ibmdbpy, please refer to the [documentation](https://pythonhosted.org/ibmdbpy/index.html) and to the dedicated [Git repository](https://github.com/ibmdbanalytics/ibmdbpy/tree/master/ibmdbpy). This notebook provides you with an overview of ibmdbpy geospatial extension.\n",

    "__About ibmdbpy's geospatial extension__\n",
    "\n",
    "Ibmdbpy supports a wrapper for spatial functions which enables you to generate and analyze spatial information about geographic features, and to store and manage the data on which this information is based. The spatial data is identified by ibmdbpy as a special class called IdaGeoDataFrame that extends all the properties of an IdaDataFrame and has additional methods supported for geospatial types like ST_Point, ST_LineString, ST_Polygon etc. Like Python package GeoPandas, which is an extension of Pandas and provides the GeoDataFrame abstraction, ibmdbpy spatial extension lets you play with IdaGeoDataFrames and IdaGeoSeries as an extension of IdaDataFrames and IdaSeries. The Python wrappers for spatial functions which Db2 currently supports make the querying process much simpler for users. For more details about ibmdbpy geospatial extension, please refer to the dedicated [documentation](https://pythonhosted.org/ibmdbpy/geospatial.html). More details about Db2 spatial extender can be found on the [IBM Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCJDQ/com.ibm.swg.im.dashdb.spatial.doc/doc/csbp1001.html).\n",

Note that an IdaGeoDataFrame inherits all the properties of an IdaDataFrame, so you could also simply open it as an IdaDataFrame if you do not need to manipulate its geospatial information, and convert it back any time into an IdaGeoDataFrame. For conversion, use the `IdaGeoDataFrame.from_IdaDataFrame` function.
