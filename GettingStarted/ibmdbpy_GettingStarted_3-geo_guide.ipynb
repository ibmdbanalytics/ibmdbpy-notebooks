    "### Accelerate Python analytics with in-database processing by using ibmdbpy and IBM Db2 Warehouse\n",
    " \n",
    "The ibmdbpy project provides a Python interface for data manipulation and access to in-database algorithms in IBM Db2 Warehouse. It accelerates Python analytics by seamlessly pushing operations written in Python into the underlying database for execution, thereby benefitting from in-database performance-enhancing features, such as columnar storage and parallel processing. For more details about ibmdbpy, please refer to the [documentation](https://pythonhosted.org/ibmdbpy/index.html) and to the dedicated [Git repository](https://github.com/ibmdbanalytics/ibmdbpy/tree/master/ibmdbpy). This notebook provides you with an overview of ibmdbpy geospatial extension.\n",

    "__About ibmdbpy's geospatial extension__\n",
    "\n",
    "Ibmdbpy supports a wrapper for spatial functions which enables you to generate and analyze spatial information about geographic features, and to store and manage the data on which this information is based. The spatial data is identified by ibmdbpy as a special class called IdaGeoDataFrame that extends all the properties of an IdaDataFrame and has additional methods supported for geospatial types like ST_Point, ST_LineString, ST_Polygon etc. Like Python package GeoPandas, which is an extension of Pandas and provides the GeoDataFrame abstraction, ibmdbpy spatial extension lets you play with IdaGeoDataFrames and IdaGeoSeries as an extension of IdaDataFrames and IdaSeries. The Python wrappers for spatial functions which Db2 currently supports make the querying process much simpler for users. For more details about ibmdbpy geospatial extension, please refer to the dedicated [documentation](https://pythonhosted.org/ibmdbpy/geospatial.html). More details about Db2 spatial extender can be found on the [IBM Knowledge Center](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCJDQ/com.ibm.swg.im.dashdb.spatial.doc/doc/csbp1001.html).\n",

The methods we show you here are applied on an IdaGeoDataFrame (say, `ida1`) with a second IdaGeoDataFrame as parameter (say, `ida2`). It returns a new IdaGeoDataFrame (let's call it `result`) containing three columns: IDs from `ida1`, IDs from `ida2`and the result of a given operation for each pair of input values.

The two IdaGeoDataFrames have inherited their `geometry` attribute from the `counties` IdaGeoDataFrame. Their column `SHAPE` is set as geometry. `result` is a new IdaGeoDataFrame obtained by applying the `distance` method to `ida1` with `ida2` as parameter. It contains as many distances as pairs (geom1, geom2) of elements geom1 from the geometry column of `ida1`, geom2 from the geometry column of `ida2`. 31 times 5 makes 155, so we are good. \n",

    "A handful of methods to help you explore these topics: `crosses` (whether the geometry of the first IdaGeoDataFrame crosses the second),`intersects` (whether two geometries intersect each other), `mbr_intersects` (same for minimum bounding rectangles of each geometry), `disjoint` (opposite of intersection), `overlaps` () and `touches` ().\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic rules about geometry dimensions apply. For example, in the case of `crosses`: if the intersection of the two geometries results in a geometry that has a dimension that is one less than the maximum dimension of the two given geometries, and if the resulting geometry is not equal to any of the two given geometries, then 1 is returned. Incompatible dimensions: if the first geometry is a polygon or a multipolygon, or if the second geometry is a point or multipoint, or if any of the geometries is null value or is empty, then null is returned. Otherwise, the result is 0 (zero).\n",
