    " \n",
    "The ibmdbpy project provides access to in-database algorithms in IBM Db2 Warehouse through a Python interface for data manipulation. It accelerates Python analytics by seamlessly pushing operations written in Python into the underlying database for execution, thereby benefitting from in-database performance-enhancing features, such as columnar storage and parallel processing. For more details about ibmdbpy, please refer to the [documentation](https://pythonhosted.org/ibmdbpy/index.html) and to the dedicated [Git repository](https://github.com/ibmdbanalytics/ibmdbpy/tree/master/ibmdbpy). This notebook provides you with an overview of ibmdbpy functionalities. \n",
