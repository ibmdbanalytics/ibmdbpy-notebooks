# Demo notebooks for ibmdbpy using IBM Db2 Warehouse

In this folder, you find Jupyter notebooks showcasing ibmdbpy, an open-source package for in-database analytics, in interaction with IBM Db2 Warehouse.

Ibmdbpy is an open-source project developed by IBM. It provides a pandas-like Python interface for data handling and efficient in-database analytics. By seamlessly pushing operations written in Python into the underlying database for execution, it benefits from in-database performance-enhancing features such as columnar storage and parallel processing. The use of in-database algorithms and stored procedures from IBM Db2 Warehouse through ibmdbpy enables you to accelerates Python analytics.

The Jupyter notebooks provided in this folder contain useful tutorials and use cases to get you started with ibmdbpy. 

The ibmdbpy source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ibmdbanalytics/ibmdbpy) and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ibmdbpy/).

Please visit the [ibmdbpy documentation](https://pythonhosted.org/ibmdbpy/start.html) for more information.
